About me

Hello,<br>
My name is Branimir JeliÄ‡. I'm 23 year old programmer, developer from Slavonski Brod, Croatia.<br> 
As a developer, my strongest areas are problem solving, object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms. I'm also good at web development, database design, system installation and maintenance. <br>
Languages and technologies I've learned are Python, .Net (C#, ASP.Net), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL) etc. I'm constantly looking to further expand my skills by learning new and more advanced techniques and technologies.
